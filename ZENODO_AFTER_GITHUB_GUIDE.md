# Completing Zenodo metadata after the GitHub migration

The eight version DOI values have already been established. Do not create replacement records.

## Wait for Codex and GitHub first

For each paper, wait until:

- the migration pull request is merged;
- the immutable GitHub tag/release exists;
- the final PDF, source ZIP, reviewer packet, and checksums have been generated from the merged source;
- the final upload manifest matches those files.

## Complete each record

1. Open the existing record in the `danielhjeffery` Zenodo account. Paper 06 is published; the other seven records remain drafts.
2. Confirm the version DOI matches `ZENODO_DOI_MAPPING.json`.
3. Creator: `Metriq PRISM Laboratory` as an organization, affiliation `Metriq Foundation, Inc.`
4. Contributor: `Jeffery, Daniel H.`, role `Project leader`, ORCID `0009-0001-1200-6042`.
5. Resource type: `Publication - Preprint`.
6. Add the final files listed in `FINAL_ZENODO_UPLOAD_MANIFEST.md`.
7. Add the immutable GitHub release as a related identifier using scheme `URL`; use `Is supplemented by` for source/reproducibility material.
8. Confirm license `CC BY 4.0` for the manuscript. The source archive contains the separate MIT notice for code.
9. Add the Metriq PRISM Laboratory community when available.
10. Preview the citation and file list.
11. Save metadata and file corrections without publishing unless publication is explicitly authorized.

## Paper 05

Keep DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21434602` as an unpublished draft until the source authors clarify the intended formulation or Daniel explicitly authorizes publication as a wording/interpretation note.

## ORCID

After each Zenodo record is published and the DOI resolves, add the work to ORCID using the DOI. Preserve the documented organizational-creator and corresponding-contributor credits.
